 Simulating the processes running on a processor
                 SIMULATING THE PROCESSES RUNNING ON A PROCESSOR

I was asked to simulate the processes running on a processor. Each process will have the following
features: ID, Priority, Arrivaltime, Runtime. Runtime is an integer which shows the number of cycles
of the remaining execution time of the process.
The time unit in the simulator is cycles. Arrivaltime and Runtime are in the unit of cycles of execution.
Priority is indicated by an integer which can be 1, 2 or 3. Smaller value indicates a higher priority.
The simulator keeps track of the object Running_Process of type Process which shows the current
process in execution. If there are no processes in the system, the ID of the Running_Process is -1.
When a process starts execution in the processor, it is copied in the Running_Process and its Runtime
is decremented in each cycle. When Runtime is 0, the process finishes the execution. The latency of
each process is defined as follows: Finish time-Arrival time
If a new process arrives at an idle system (the processor is idle, process queue and process stack are
empty) it starts execution immediately.
We need to store the arriving processes if the processor is already executing a process. There are 3
separate process queues for each priority that store the arriving proceses that we call Q1, Q2 and Q3.
There is a single process stack that stores the preempted processes.
When a new process with priority i (Pi) arrives, if there are any processes in the system (in the
queues, on the stack or in execution) with a higher or equal priority, Pi is inserted in Qi.
If during the execution of a process a higher priority process arrives, then the current process in
exection is preempted and pushed on the process stack as explained with an example scenario
below.
When the processor finishes the execution of a process, it should select the highest priority process
in the system as the next process to execute. If there are two highest priority processes, it selects the
older one.
Example: Assume the system is idle at t=0.
At t=0: Process P1 arives with Priority=3 and Runtime=50. P1 Starts execution.
At t=10: Process P2 arrives with Priority=2 and Runtime=70. P1 is preempted and pushed onto the
stack with Runtime=40. P2 starts execution.
At t=20: Process P3 arrives with Priority=3 and Runtime=30. Stored in Q3.
At t=30: Process P4 arrives with Priority=1 and Runtime=10. P2 is preempted and pushed onto the
stack with Runtime=50. P3 starts execution. Stack has P1 and P2 (top).
At t=40: P4 completes. Processor has to select the next process to run among P3 in Q3 and P2 on
stack. Selects P2 (higher priority). P2 resumes execution with Runtime=50.
At t=50: P5 arrives with priority 2 and Runtime=30. P2 is not preempted as it has the same priority
and it is older. P5 is stored in Q2.
At t=60: P6 arrives with priority 1 and Runtime = 10. P2 is preempted with Runtime=30. P6 starts
execution.
At t=70: P6 completes. Processor has to select the next process to run among P3 in Q3, P5 in Q2 and
P2 on stack. Selects P2 (higher priority than P3, older than P5). P2 resumes execution with
Runtime=30.
At t=100: P2 completes. Processor has to select the next process to run among P3 in Q3, P5 in Q2 and
P2 and P1 on stack. Selects P5 (higher priority).
Input and output files for the example scenario are distributed with the homework. More examples
for selecting the next process to run:
1) If Q1 has a process and top of the stack has priority 2, Q1 is dequeued and process starts
execution.
2) If Q1 is empty and Q2 has a process and top of the stack has priority 1, stack is popped and
the preempted process resumes.
3) If Q1 is empty and Q2 has a process and top of the stack has priority 3, Q2 is dequeued and
process starts execution.
4) If Q1 has a process and top of the stack has priority 1, the stack is popped and the preempted
process resumes.
Note that the latency inlcudes the Runtime and all possible additional times the process spends in
the queue and in the stack.
Before the simulator starts to run, it takes a text file (input.txt) as input which describes the process
arrivals in the following format:
ID Priority Arrivaltime Runtime
where ID, Priority, Arrivaltime and Runtime are integers. Each line contains the information for one
process. Simulation runs until the execution of all processes in the input file are completed.
You are going to provide a log file in the form of .txt with all arrival, finish, push, pop and preemption
events in the simulation, clearly indicating the time the events occur. See the example file for the
output format.
You will report the latency for each process ID on a separate .txt file. This file should be sorted in
terms of processesâ€™ finish order.
You need to implement your own Stack and Queue classes. You can use the codes in the lecture
notes. At any time of the simulation, there could be up to 1000 processes in each queue. That is, your
queues should be able to store at least 1000 elements. (For the stack, maximum number of elements
is 2.)
